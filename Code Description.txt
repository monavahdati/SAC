✅ Code Description – Discrete SAC for BNPL Credit Decision
This project implements a Discrete Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent tailored to optimize credit suggestions in a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) scenario. The agent learns a policy over discrete credit offerings and aims to balance approval strategy with user repayment probability.

🔧 1. QNetwork
Approximates the soft Q-values for state-action pairs:

python
Copy
Edit
Linear(state) → ReLU → Linear → ReLU → Linear → Q(s, a)
Two separate Q-networks (Q1, Q2) are used to mitigate overestimation.

🧠 2. PolicyNetwork
Learns a stochastic policy π(a|s) via softmax over logits.
Returns both:

probs: action probabilities

log_probs: log of probabilities (for entropy regularization)

📦 3. Replay Buffer
A classic experience buffer that stores tuples of:
(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
Allows sampling random mini-batches for stable training.

🧪 4. Environment: SimpleBNPLEnv
Simulates BNPL context where:

State = user features

Action = a discrete credit offer (amount, duration)

Reward:

+2: user accepted and paid back

-1: user accepted but didn’t pay

+1: credit wasn’t given and user defaulted

-2: credit wasn’t given but user would’ve paid

🧰 5. Discrete SAC Agent
Combines:

Two Q-networks + targets: Q₁, Q₂

Policy network: π(a|s)

Entropy-weighted policy update

Soft target updates:

python
Copy
Edit
target_param = τ * param + (1 - τ) * target_param
🔁 6. Training Loop
Across 50 episodes:

Agent interacts with environment, stores transitions

Policy and Q-networks are updated per batch

Accuracy is monitored by converting pred != 0 → “credit offered”

📊 7. Metrics Tracked
Total reward per episode

Training accuracy

Validation accuracy

(Optional) losses per Q-function and policy

💡 Use Case
Discrete SAC is ideal for:

High-stakes credit decisions with exploration-exploitation trade-offs

Learning nuanced user behavior over time

Replacing rule-based credit strategies with adaptive policies
